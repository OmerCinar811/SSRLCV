\chapter{N/Multiview Reprojection}

\section{Overview}

For the purpose of our software, we expect a set of points $P_n = (p_x, p_y, p_z)$
and their corresponding orientation as a unit vector $\hat{P}_n = (\hat{u}_x, \hat{u}_y, \hat{u}_z)$
orientations , at this stage we are exclusivley in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

Caleb made up the name to this method, so don't search it because you probably
won't find anything about it. \\
